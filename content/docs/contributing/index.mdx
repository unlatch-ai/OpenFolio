## What to Work On

- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/unlatch-ai/OpenFolio/issues) for open tasks
- Look for `good first issue` labels for beginner-friendly tasks
- Propose new features by opening an issue first

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript** with strict mode
- **2-space indentation**, semicolons required
- **kebab-case** for files, **PascalCase** for components
- All data queries must use `ctx.workspaceId` for workspace isolation
- API routes must use `getWorkspaceContext()` for auth
- New features should include tests

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include a clear description of what changed and why
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update docs if your change affects the public API or user-facing behavior
- Ensure all tests pass before requesting review

## Architecture Decisions

For significant changes, please discuss the approach in an issue before starting work. This helps avoid wasted effort and ensures alignment with the project direction.

See [Architecture](/docs/architecture) for an overview of how the system works.
