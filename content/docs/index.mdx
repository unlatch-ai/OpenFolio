# OpenFolio Documentation

OpenFolio is an **open-source, AI-native personal CRM**. It helps you organize your professional network, track interactions, and get AI-powered insights about your relationships.

## What is OpenFolio?

OpenFolio stores your contacts, companies, and interactions — then uses AI embeddings (via OpenAI) to enable semantic search and an intelligent assistant that understands your network.

**Key features:**

- **People & Companies** — Organize contacts with rich profiles, tags, and notes
- **Interaction Tracking** — Log emails, meetings, calls, and more
- **AI Assistant** — Ask natural language questions about your network
- **Semantic Search** — Find contacts by meaning, not just keywords
- **Integrations** — Import from CSV, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts
- **Multi-Workspace** — Separate personal and professional networks
- **Self-Hostable** — Run on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose
