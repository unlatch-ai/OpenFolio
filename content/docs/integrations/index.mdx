# Integrations

OpenFolio connects to external services to import your contacts and interactions.

## Available Integrations

| Integration | Type | What It Imports |
|-------------|------|-----------------|
| **CSV** | File upload | People from CSV files |
| **Google Gmail** | OAuth | Email interactions |
| **Google Calendar** | OAuth | Meeting interactions |
| **Google Contacts** | OAuth | People with phone numbers, addresses, etc. |

## How Integrations Work

1. **Connect** — OAuth flow or file upload
2. **Sync** — Connector fetches data and normalizes it
3. **Process** — The Integration Gateway upserts people, creates companies, links interactions
4. **Embed** — Background jobs generate embeddings for new/updated entities

All integrations go through the same gateway, ensuring consistent data handling regardless of source.

## Managing Integrations

Go to **Settings > Integrations** in the dashboard to:
- Connect new integrations
- View sync status and history
- Disconnect integrations
