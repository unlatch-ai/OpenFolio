# CSV Import

Import contacts from any CSV file.

## How It Works

1. Go to **Settings > Import**
2. Upload a CSV file (max 10 MB)
3. Map CSV columns to OpenFolio fields (email, first_name, last_name, etc.)
4. Review the mapping and start the import

## Column Mapping

The import UI suggests column mappings based on header names. You can manually adjust:

| OpenFolio Field | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `email` | Contact email address (used for deduplication) |
| `first_name` | First name |
| `last_name` | Last name |
| `phone` | Phone number |
| `company_name` | Company name (auto-creates company) |
| `job_title` | Job title / role |
| `location` | Location |
| `bio` | Bio or notes |
| `skip` | Ignore this column |

## Deduplication

Contacts are deduplicated by email address within the workspace. If a person with the same email already exists, their record is updated with new data (non-null fields override).

## Import Progress

Large imports run in the background via Trigger.dev. You can track progress in the Settings page.
