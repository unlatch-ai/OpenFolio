# Google Integration

Connect Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts to import interactions and contacts on demand.

## Setup

See [Google OAuth Setup](/docs/self-hosting/google-oauth) for credential configuration.

## What Gets Synced

### Gmail
- Email messages as interactions
- Sender and recipient emails linked to contacts
- Subject line and message body

### Google Calendar
- Calendar events as interactions
- Event attendees linked to contacts
- Event title, description, and time

### Google Contacts
- Contact names, emails, phone numbers
- Organization and job title
- Social profiles (if available)

## Incremental Sync

After the initial sync, subsequent syncs only fetch new or updated items using sync cursors. This is efficient and avoids re-processing old data.

## Sync Frequency

Syncs can run on demand from Settings > Integrations, and each connected integration can be configured for daily automatic sync.

## Disconnecting

Disconnecting a Google integration:
- Revokes the stored OAuth tokens
- Does **not** delete previously imported data
- Can be reconnected at any time
